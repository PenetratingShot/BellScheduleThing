# Bell Schedule Dark Mode

So there's this app developed by a kid at my school. It shows the scheduling information and class times every day. This is a partial dark mode support for the app. When I say partial, I mean that the settings view and the main view controller work perfectly, however the information table view controller labels are black, which makes them quite literally impossible to see. Working on a fix for this soon.
